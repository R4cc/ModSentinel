# ModSentinel
A lightweight tool for managing Minecraft mods. Paste in any Modrinth or CurseForge link, choose your version and loader (Fabric, Forge, Quilt, etc.), and ModWatch will track updates for you. It checks which of your mods are out of date and can download the latest versions automatically.
